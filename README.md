## 📝 Exercise 1 : Back-end

A django project has been initialized with only a few models.

Help administrators view the StorageBoxes created by users through the admin area :

* The lists should display the latest boxes created at the top of the list.
* It must be possible to filter boxes according to surface area
* It must be possible to filter boxes by availability (the administrator must be able to enter a date range).


## 📝 Exercise 2 : Front-end

Still in the same project, create a page to show site users the available boxes.

Users should be able to filter or sort by price, surface area, etc.
